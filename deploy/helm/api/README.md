# api Helm Chart

A README for a chart should be formatted in Markdown (README.md), and should generally contain:

A description of the application or service the chart provides
Any prerequisites or requirements to run the chart
Descriptions of options in values.yaml and default values
Any other information that may be relevant to the installation or configuration of the chart

When hubs and other user interfaces display details about a chart that detail is pulled from the content in the README.md file.
